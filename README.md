Project Sano - Together we stay healthy

## Project goal
An system of and for the people to acquire and maintain your a proof of health. 

## Concept
Together we stay healthy. 

## Summary
During the covid19 pandemic we have all probably noticed that it is hard to follow the strict social distancing and sanitation measures needed to prevent and contain spread of communicable diseases. The basic principle of these measures all come down to these two facts: 1. If you reduce the amount of infectious moments you reduce your chance of infection, 2. If you reduce the amount of infectious moments it is easier to contain spread. So 
zero infectious moments will equate to zero infections, it is only nearly impossible to achieve. That is why we want to implement and provide digital tools and information to help reduce infectious moments as much as possible. 

## Techniques we want to test:
Approach the problem as if we are handling infection moments as if they is radiation exposure, in which the higher the exposure the higher the risk of getting sick. Maximum exposure limits in place. Use GPS to figure out what the exposure is at a specific spot based on questions to the user (indoors or outdoors, well ventilated, how many people there). 
Use indoor outdoor principle of ventilation. Indoor poorly ventilated areas in which people are in, accumulate micro droplets that can contain infectious diseases. Outdoors with wind will severely reduce infections. 
Location limits. Helps you keep track and limit the total number of places you visit in a day.
